        What I created:
        <br><font size=3px>
        I created an art piece using JavaScript to express what I love as well as show what I learned on this round of expeditions.
        <br>
        In my webpage, I express my feelings and thoughts through skills I have learned in class such as using loops and conditions. I created
        <br>
        the sun where the sun rises and sets and lets the interactors choose the day or night sky using the mouse. I included snow
        <br>
        because it's winter for me right now and it's the feeling that helped me develope this art piece. The text and image I decided
        <br>
        to add was because it was something I loved from the moment I saw it and thought it would nicely corrospond w/ what I was doing.
        <br>
        This project works to help us learn and start out on Javascript and make our own work using what we learn.

        <h1>
        Shapes:
        </h1>
        <br>
        <h2>
        Why:
        <br><font size=3px>
        In my artwork, shapes were very important to express what I needed to and I had to understand how to create them.
        <br>
        There are about 7 shapes to create different objects that I could use but in the end, I only used about 3 shapes.
        <br><font size=5px>
        How I Went:
        <br><font size=3px>
        Using the ellipse, rect, and arc syntax, I learned how to make these shapes look the way I want to express myself in art.
        <br>
        I do this by using:
        <br>
        <ul>
        <li> arc(x, y, width, height, start, stop);</li>
        <li>ellipse(x, y, width, height);</li>
        <li>rect(x, y, width, height);</li>
        </ul>
        By using these codes in Javascript, I am able to apply these shapes into my artwork to make it unique for myself.
        <br>
        I decided what I wanted to do first which orignally was just the sun rising and setting but then I decided
        <br>
        to add Earth and then add snow. I also had the rect/square as the mouse because it is easier to see and use.
        <br>
        It took me a while to learn how to use the arc syntax for Earth but when I learned how, it was great
        <br>
        because I was able to include something I didn't originally have in mind but wanted to include for a better representation.
        <br>
        Something I have to remember when creating shapes would be the syntax of each shape because along the way of doing
        <br>
        this project, I continuously had to check what each part was even though I used it frequently. When using these
        <br>
        codes, I continuously changed the numbers around to figure out how they worked as well as what I wanted to
        <br>
        do with them. Often times when using shapes there will be a place to put x and y axis coordinates in as well as the
        <br>
        width and height of the shape so that it can look the way we want it to.
        </h2>
        <h2>
        <a href="imgs/shapes.jpg"><img src="imgs/shapes.jpg" alt=""></a>
        <font size=3px><br>
        These codes show the use of rect, arc, and ellipses. The first 2 numbers are x and y
        <br>
        coordinates where the next numbers are different for each shape but are often width and height of the shape.
        <br>
        The fill code is the color of the shape, the stroke is the color of the border of the shape, and the strokeweight
        <br>
        is how thick the border would be for the shape.

            Conditionals:
        </h1>
        <br>
        <h2>
            Why:
            <br><font size=3px>
            In my artwork, I used conditionals to change the background color depending on the mouse as well as make
            <br>
            the sun move around. I also used conditionals to for the raindrops so that they wouldn't fall every frame.
            <br><font size=5px>
            How I Went:
            <br><font size=3px>
            To use conditionals, I used the if() and else() syntax to create my conditional for the background and sun.
            <br>
            When deciding what I wanted to do, I wanted to change the background color corresponding with the sun but eventually
            <br>
            I decided that I wanted the interaction between the person looking at the art and the art would be being able
            <br> 
            to change the time of day it is. I did this because its daytime somewhere else in the world and night in other places
            <br>
            so the interactor could choose which part they want as day or night. I did this by using the if() and else() conditional.
            <br>
            To set it up, I put my expression into the parentheses so that it can run and see if it is true or false. Then depending on the
            <br>
            statement I put in (which is mouseX > 200), it would run either the statement in if() or run the else() statement if the statement is
            <br>
            false. The statement I put in was changing the background color so that others could interact with the art using the 
            <br>
            mouse. I also used conditionals to get the sun moving around the earth through changing the x and y in the staement.

        <h2>
            <a href="imgs/conditions.jpg"><img src="imgs/conditions.jpg" alt=""></a>
            <font size=3px><br>
            For my art, inside the condition is (mouse > 200) and (x > 200) and has a statement where if it is true or false, 
            <br>
            then the statement runs. One statement I have would change the background from the day sky to night sky. The other
            <br>
            condition has a statement for the sun to move around the earth.

        <h1>
            Loops:
        </h1>
        <br>
        <h2>
            Why:
            <br><font size=3px>
            In my art, loops was the last thing I was able to get to because I didn't know what I wanted to include that used loops.
            <br>
            I originally wanted my art to be an uncover the picture thing but then I had the idea of representing what happens in life and
            <br>
            include what I love. Later, I was given the idea that I could loop w/ the snow so that it would fall but not for every frame.
            <br><font size=5px>
            How I Went:
            <br><font size=3px>
            To loop I had to use the for() loop. This was one of the hardest for me to understand and imput into my art piece when trying to 
            <br>
            create the snowdrops to run and drop down. I had to create a variable at 0 and then if it is less then a certain amount,
            <br>
            the snow would drop down and loop around so that the snow would continuously loop and fall. But because it looped so often,
            <br>
            I had to add a timer so that the snow didn't fall every frame and only come down once in a while instead of a lot coming down every frame.

            <a href="imgs/loops.jpg"><img src="imgs/loops.jpg" alt=""></a>
            <font size=3px><br>
            This loop for my art is here to loop the snow so that it continuously drawn and falls. It drops for the length and is added
            <br>
            each time it falls and loops around.

            Functions:
        </h1>
        <br>
        <h2>
            Why:
            <br><font size=3px>
            In my art, I used functions to set up my image and draw my snow so that it would be able to be inserted. The image is
            <br>
            a big part of my art as well as the snow. I used the function to be able to draw them into my art and have it set up.
            <br><font size=5px>
            How I Went:
            <br><font size=3px>
            To use functions I had to setup my function outside the draw so that it would create what I wanted before putting
            <br>
            it into the art piece. For the image, I had to load the image and for the snow I had to create the snow and setup the
            <br>
            falling of the snow. When creating these functions, I had recieved help to understand how to setup the function outside.
            <br>
            Once setting up the function outside the draw function, I had to put the creating part into the draw fuction so that it
            <br>
            would actually draw and be put into the art.

            <font size=3px><br>
            This function for my art created what the object I wanted to be drawn and the function also creates the falling of the
            <br>
            snow and where the x and y coordinates would be.

            My Take Away:
        </h1>
        <br>
        <h2><font size=3px>
            In this project, I had to understand how to create all these functions that I used in my art like loops, functions, and conditions.
            <br>
            If I hadn't originally learned how to create these, I wouldn't have known how to start on my art. I also had the sun animation included
            <br>
            in which I wouldn't have known how to do if I hadn't learned that the background should be in the draw so that it looped and not
            <br>
            have the sun repeat on the screen. I had to understand the syntax of what I was using and have a clear image of what I wanted to create
            <br>
            beforehand so that I wasn't super stuck in the middle of creating my art. The image in my head had changed multiple times until I was able
            <br>
            to finalize what I wanted to be done. Within this project, my takeaway would be everything I had learned as well as the facts that
            <br>
            I should always learn what I want to do before creating and that background can be used to animate without repetition of the object.

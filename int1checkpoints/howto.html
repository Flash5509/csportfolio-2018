        What I created:
        <br><font size=3px>
        I created a webpage about me and what I have learned in my first round of expeditions.
        <br>
        In my webpage, I stated some facts about me and skills that I have gotten out of my class.

        <h2>
            Why:
            <br><font size=3px>
            In my about me page, I added images for people to relate more and have a better understanding
            <br>
            about me and what I like as well as to get my point across.
            <br><font size=5px>
            How:
            <br><font size=3px>
            Using the tag &lt;img scr&gt;, makes images show up when you put a link to the picture.
            <br><font size=5px>
            For Example:
            <br><font size=3px>
            Putting the codes:
            <br>
            &lt;img width=&quot;210px&quot;scr &lt;img scr= &lt;img src=&quot;https://encrypted-tbn0.gstatic.com/images?q=tbn:ANd9GcQQ6L2thdRnGjrE83BTk-UMMAEz_gF3kr8kfrdjseg7DQ_deuL1&quot; alt=&quot;Related image&quot;/&gt;<br/>
            &lt;img width=&quot;20px&quot;&gt;
            <br><br>
            This will create an image that you want and in this case a quote
            <br>as well as space between the image (20px):

        <h2>
            Why:
            <br><font size=3px>
            In my about me page, I added different backgrounds as well as fonts and borders.
            <br>
            This added design to my webpage and showed a little about me.
            <br><font size=5px>
            How:
            <br><font size=3px>
            Using the tags
            <br><font size=5px>
            For Example:
            <br><font size=3px>
            Putting the codes:
            <br>
            body{
            <br/>text-align: center;<br/>}<br/>h1{<br/>
            font-family: &quot;Comic Sans MS&quot;, &quot;Comic Sans&quot;, cursive;<br/>
            background-color:#ffff66;<br/>
            border:2px solid black;<br/>
            border-radius:15px;<br/>
            margin:-5px;<br/>}<br/>h2{<br/>
            background-color:#ff704d;<br/>
            border:3px dashed black;<br/>
            margin:-5px;<br/>}<br/>bodytwo{<br/>
            text-align:center;<br/>}<br/>p{<br/>
            background-color:#909090;<br/>
            border:3px dashed black;<br/>}
            <br><br>
            This will create different fonts, different background colors, different types of borders,
            <br>as well as margins in css instead of html which means that it can be applied to the parts
            <br> stated instead of just specific sections you would get in html.:
        </h2>
        <br>
        <h2><font size=3px>
            All the color, borders (dashed and solid), margins, text-aligning, and different fonts
            <br>in this webpage is just a part of the different designs. (I'm not sure how to show
            <br> design so I have resorted to just describing different parts of it in my own webpage).

        <h2>
            Why:
            <br><font size=3px>
            In my about me page, I have an ordered list as well as an unordered list.
            <br>
            This helps organize what I want to be stated where an ordered list has numbers
            <br> and an unordered list has bullet points.
            <br><font size=5px>
            How:
            <br><font size=3px>
            Using the tag &lt;ol&gt; and &lt;ul&gt;, the &lt;ol&gt; tag is used to create an ordered list.
            <br>
            The &lt;ul&gt; tag is used to create an unordered list. The &lt;li&gt;&lt;/li&gt; is what's
            <br>used to actually put what you want inside the list.
            <br><font size=5px>
            For example:
            <br><font size=3px>
            Putting the codes: 
            <br>
            &lt;ol&gt<br>&lt;font size=4px&gt;<br/>

            &lt;li&gt;Changing borders and adding background color in words
            &lt;/li&gt;<br/>
            &lt;/ol&gt;
            <br><br>
            This will create an ordered list:

        <br>
        <h2>
            Why:
            <br><font size=3px>
            The body tag is what defines the document's body and the content inside. From
            <br> having spacing to having paragraphs as well as headings.
            <br><font size=5px>
            How:
            <br><font size=3px>
            Using the tag &lt;body&gt;, &lt;br&gt;, &lt;p&gt;, and &lt;h1&gt;, this makes it
            <br> so that you have a place to put what you want to write, have spacing, write a
            <br>paragraph with a small font, and have a heading in different sizes depending on
            <br> which heading you want. The range of headings go from &lt;h1&gt; to &lt;h6&gt;.
            <br><font size=5px>
            For example:
            <br><font size=3px>
            Putting the code:
            <br>
            &lt;body&gt;<br/>
            &lt;bold&gt;Facts&lt;/bold&gt;<br/>
            &lt;/h1&gt;<br/>
            &lt;p&gt;<br/>I am a sophmore at Summit Rainier High School. I love reading and music. <br/>
            &lt;br&gt;<br/>
            &lt;/p&gt;<br/>
            &lt;/body&gt;
            <br><br>
            This will create a body:

            Hyperlinks (tag):

        <br>
        <h2>
            Why:
            <br><font size=3px>
            Hyperlinks are used to bring you to a different page quickly in a click without
            <br>having to type in a new url.
            <br><font size=5px>
            How:
            <br><font size=3px>
            Using the tag &lt;a&gt;, this makes a hyperlink which depending on how you use it,
            <br> it can bring you to a different page or just bring you to a different part of
            <br> the webpage.
            <br><font size=5px>
            For example:
            <br><font size=3px>
            Putting the code:
            <br>
            &lt;ul id=&quot;navbar&quot;&gt;<br/>
            &lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=index.html&quot;&gt; About Me &lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;<br/>
            &lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=favoritethings.html&quot;&gt; Favorite &lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;<br/>
            &lt;/ul&gt;
            
            <br><br>
            This will create a hyper link: (but it may be unresponsive)

            What I thought during the project:
            <br><font size=3px>
            During this project, I saw other students doing hyper links and that got me thinking because
            <br>I did not understand how it worked. I do now understand after searching up ways to add links
            <br>towards different parts of my webpage. I tested many different things for the hyperlink because
            <br>I did not understand where the link was going to. But after testing (by putting the code 
            <br>in different parts of the body's, I figured out where it was going and how it worked. Figuring
            <br>out how to add different fonts was also hard for me because I was unsure about what the website
            <br>meant with different font families. When looking up different fonts, the website I went to 
            <br>talked about font families and many more. At first I was confused, this was until I read everything
            <br>and understood how different fonts and font sizes worked within a body. The last things that
            <br>also was super confusing to me in the beginning was background colors. This was because I was
            <br>unsure as to how the numbers and letters worked. Sometimes I would try out different letters
            <br>and it wouldn't work. I realised that the code went rrggbb which is red, green, and blue.
            <br>So this was how my project turned out :)

            What I created:
        <br><font size=3px>
            In this round of expeditions, I created an interactive website using HTML and Javascript to solve a problem people may have.
        <br>
            In my interactive website, I made a tracker for those who travel the world to keep track of the countries people have been to.
        <br>
            I decided to make this because I have done some traveling in my life and I sometimes don't remember everywhere I have gone so to have
        <br>
            a tracker is very useful. This project works to help me learn more about HTML and Javascript together as well as learn how to use
        <br>
            eventlisteners, onclicks, style, innerHTML, functions, and variables. Everything I have learned will help me in the future and is useful.

            Buttons & Button IDs:
        <br><font size=3px>
            In my webpage, I used buttons to show the countries and button IDs to create variables to get the colorchange and display. I had to use
        <br>
            buttons to click and show the countries. In the webpage, I created a button/button id in HTML and then created a variable in Javascript
        <br>
            with the ID's. Using the variables, I was able to do a style display change where when you click on a specific continent, other countries
        <br>
            disappear so that the countries wouldn't get jumbled. I also had it so that the countries would appear when a specific continent was
        <br>
            clicked. The tag I used for the button id's and buttons was &lt;button id=&quot;asia&quot;&gt;Asia&lt;/button&gt; for the continent
        <br>
            of asia. I also created one for the other 6 continents. Then I made many other buttons for the countries within those continents. I used
        <br>
            a list tag to order the continents and had the countries below the heading of Continents/Places I've Been. Using getElementById I was
        <br>
            able to connect HTML with my javascript and by using eventlisteners I was able to have my display of countries appear and disappear when
        <br>
            the buttons are clicked.

            Onclicks:
        <br><font size=3px>
            As I was making my webpage, I decided I wanted my buttons to change colors when clicked so I decided to use an onclick. I connected my
        <br>
            onclick with my button id for the countries so that when clicked they would turn red. I used the code
        <br>
            &lt;button id=&quot;japan&quot; onclick=&quot;changing(this, 'red')&quot;&gt;Japan&lt;/button&gt;
        <br>
            to get the color change as red. I could have used blue or green but I found that red stands out. For the onclick to work, I had to use
        <br>
            a function in my HTML that is a style color change function. The code was:
        <br>
            &lt;script&gt;<br/>        function changing(elmnt,clr) {<br/>            elmnt.style.color= clr;<br/>        }<br/>    &lt;/script&gt;

        <h2>
            Choices:
        <br><font size=3px>
            The choices I've had to make was first deciding what I wanted to make which was somewhat hard for me to do because I couldn't think
        <br>
            of any problems or specific thing I wanted to make so after some time, I decided to do a 'where I've been' website. I thought of this
        <br>
            because I have traveled a decent amount in my life and I know that if I had this then it would be useful to me and maybe other people.
        <br>
            The next choice I had to make was how I was going to go about with this project and I decided to do a button clicking webpage where
        <br>
            what you click is where you have been to. I had to decide how I would use the different codes so that they would work together and
        <br>
            make the webpage that I wanted. 
        </h2>
        <h2>
            Time:
        <br><font size=3px>
            If I had more time to do the project I would try and finish everything up, then I would try and figure out ways to make the onclick
        <br>
            disappear when clicked twice. I want to do this because currently, all you can do is have it once and then you can't go back if you
        <br>
            made a mistake by clicking the wrong thing. I would try and add more countries in and then add images as well. Another thing I would
        <br>
            add if I had mroe time is a database so that people can save where they've gone oon their computers. That would be something very
        <br>
            useful because currently when you reload, everything disappears.

            My Takeaway:
        </h1>
        <br>
        <h2>
        <font size=3px>
            In this project, my takeaway would be all the new codes I learned such as eventlisteners and getElementById. I had to understand
        <br>
            how everything worked to be able to use them and create something I found useful. Although the webpage is not completed, I am
        <br>
            still proud of what I have done because I know that if I am able to do this, I will be able to combine everything I learned and use
        <br>
            it one day to create something I am even more proud of. In the beginning of this project, I didn't know what I wanted to make and then
        <br>
            I decided to make my webpage that I currently have. If I hadn't learned everything I had, I wouldn't have known what to make and start
        <br>
            off with. I was stuck in the middle of creating everything because I didn't know how to continue through with my plan. As I was creating 
        <br>
            my webpage, I changed my mind multiple times about how I was planning everything. My takeaway of this project would be everything
        <br>
            new I learned and that I should know what I want done before doing it and then changing half of everything halfway through.
